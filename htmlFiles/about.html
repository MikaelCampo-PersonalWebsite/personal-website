        <p class="about-me-skills">
            I am a Junior Web Developer out of Fullstack Academy where I became fluent in HTML, CSS and <br>
            JavaScript.  I have also messed with Python in my free time when I was younger and took a <br>
            brief course on C++ in college.  I hope to go back and become fluent in those languages as well.

        <p class="about-me-passions">
            Some of my passions include camping, hiking, cars and gaming. I don't get to go camping or <br>
            hiking as often as I'd like to but still enjoy the times I can.  I used to work at Valvoline <br>
            doing matainence on all kinds of vehicles and learned a lot over the years.  Finally I spend <br>
            most of my free time gaming. Mostly games in the zombie genre since that has been a passion <br>
            of mine since middle school.

        <p class="about-me-pets">
            I have two pets which are both reptiles, a Greek tortoise named Crush and a Bearded Dragon <br>
            named Rico.  I've had Crush for about 5 years now and have had Rico for about 3.  I would <br>
            like to get more reptiles in the future but I would like to provide the best homes that I <br>
            can for my current pets before doing so.
