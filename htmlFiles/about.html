    <div class="about-me">
        <p class="about-me-skills">
            I am a Junior Web Developer out of Fullstack Academy where I became fluent in <br>
            HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  I have also messed with Python in my free time when <br>
            I was younger and took a brief course on C++ in college.  I hope to go back and <br>
            become fluent in those languages as well.
        </p>
        <p class="about-me-passions">
            Some of my passions include camping, hiking, cars and gaming. I don't get to <br>
            go camping or hiking as often as I'd like to but still enjoy the times I can.  <br>
            I used to work at Valvoline doing matainence on all kinds of vehicles and <br>
            learned a lot over the years.  Finally I spend most of my free time gaming.  <br>
            Mostly games in the zombie genre since that has been a passion of mine since <br>
            middle school.
        </p>
        <p class="about-me-pets">
            I have two pets which are both reptiles, a Greek tortoise named Crush and <br>
            a Bearded Dragon named Rico.  I've had Crush for about 5 years now and have <br>
            had Rico for about 3.  I would like to get more reptiles in the future but <br>
            I would like to provide the best homes that I can for my current pets before <br>
            doing so.
